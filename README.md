# User-List

**User List React App with API Integration**

Welcome to the User List React App repository, a dynamic web application that showcases a list of users fetched from a remote API. This app is a practical example of using React to interact with external data sources.

**Features:**

- **API Integration**: Retrieve user data from a remote API and display it in your app.
- **List and Details Views**: View a list of users and access individual user details.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for specific users by name or other criteria.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Easy Setup**: Get started quickly with straightforward installation and usage instructions.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Replace the API endpoint in the code with your preferred user data source.
4. Run the development server using `npm start` or `yarn start`.
5. Open the app in your browser, and explore the user list and details.

This project is designed to be an educational resource for React developers, demonstrating how to interact with APIs and build a user-centric application. We welcome contributions, bug reports, and feature requests.

Explore the code, learn from it, and build your own web applications powered by React!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
